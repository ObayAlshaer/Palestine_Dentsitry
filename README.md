All HTML, CSS, and Javascript files for my services website. 

The 'Index.html' file is named 'Home.html' in this project. 

Some notes: Upon using the website further I've noticed soemthings that should be mentioned. 

    - On the default home page, you must use the click and slide with the mouse to move the slide. Otherwise they will move on their own. 
    - On the 'Contact Us' page, there is a Google Maps iframe there, it takes a few seconds to pop up on the website, just letting you know so it 
      does not look like there is just white space. 

Any files that seem too 'recent' (past deadline time) was because I noticed when I committed from VS Code to GitHub, my full Javascript file was not uploaded, I noticed this later. The last commit was just putting in the missing javascript code so you can see it for marking. Otherwise you would notice some features on the website, but would not see the corresponding JS code, so it would not make sense. I made sure to put the full app.js file so it makes a lot more sense for your marking. I am not sure why the full JS code was not included. Specifically, it was missing the JS code for the 'submit' button to lead to the 'Thank You' page, which you would have been able to do, but would have noticed the missing corresponding JS code for it. Let me know if you have any questions about this.
