All HTML, CSS, and Javascript files for my services website. 

The 'Index.html' file is named 'Home.html' in this project. 

Some notes: Upon using the website further I've noticed soemthings that should be mentioned. 

    - On the default home page, you must use the mouse to see all three slides. They will not move on their own. 
    - On the 'Contact Us' page, there is a Google Maps iframe there, it takes a few seconds to pop up on the website, just letting you know so it 
      does not look like there is just white space. 

The link to my hosted website is: https://euphonious-licorice-9f651c.netlify.app/
